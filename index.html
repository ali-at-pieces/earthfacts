                description: "Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and is not a perfect sphere; it is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator."

                fact: "Magnetic Field",
                description: "Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core, which protects the planet from harmful solar and cosmic radiation."

            {
                fact: "Tectonic Plates",
                description: "Earth's crust is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them, causing earthquakes and volcanic activity."

                fact: "Moon",

                fact: "Seasons",
